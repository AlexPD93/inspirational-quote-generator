# ✨ Inspirational Quote Generator ✨

Created a completely serverless quote generator using AWS as our cloud back-end and NextJS/TypeScript as our front-end.

### What I did:

👨‍💻 Built a cool front-end for a quote generator

💡 Wrote a script to fetch a random inspirational quote from ZenQuotes' API

🌩 Used AWS to generate a quote graphic for you in the cloud & then let you download the file

🔥 Deployed live on AWS

This build combines ZenQuotes' amazing API for fetching quotes, AWS Amplify for framework deployment and hosting, NextJS and Typescript for our front-end, styled-components to handle our styling, and some spicy backend scripting 🌶
